# Blind Grading System for Ethical Law School

## Project Commission
Ethical Law School would like to remove all bias between professors and student exams. In order to achieve this there needs to be a layer of abstraction between exam attempts and the student name/ID numbers that took those exams. The faculty will then grade submissions not knowing who the student was and therefore unable to channel any subconscious bias when grading. The database contains contains data about students, exams, and courses. The database used is MySQL and the application will be built on the Laravel framework for PHP.
